# 🚗 Smart City Parking Management System

## 📌 Introduction
The **Smart City Parking Management System** is designed to optimize parking in urban areas by providing **real-time tracking**, **dynamic pricing**, and **reservation features**. It integrates parking lots, meters, and users (drivers) through a **centralized database**. 

This system enhances **smart city applications** by monitoring each parking spot and updating users in real-time, reducing congestion and improving parking efficiency.

## 🎯 System Objectives
✅ **Real-Time Availability:** Track and display available parking spots across multiple locations.  
✅ **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust pricing based on time, demand, and location.  
✅ **User Reservations:** Allow drivers to book parking spots in advance, with penalties for non-use.  
✅ **Role-Based Access:** Differentiate between **drivers, parking lot managers, and system administrators**.  
✅ **Web Integration:** Provide a web-based interface for searching, reserving, and navigating to parking spots.

## 🛠️ Project Requirements & Features

### 🚏 **1. Parking Lot Management**
- **Profiles**: Each parking lot has a name, location, capacity, parking types, and pricing structure.
- **Spot Status**: Tracks each spot’s availability (Occupied, Available, Reserved).
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Implements surge pricing during peak hours.

### 👤 **2. User Management**
- **Driver Profiles**: Users register with personal details, license plate, and payment method.
- **Reservations**: Users can search for spots, reserve them, and get real-time directions.
- **Reservation Rules**: Includes penalties for no-shows and automatic spot release.

### 📡 **3. IoT-Based Parking Spot Monitoring (Simulated)**
- **Real-Time Sensors (Simulated)**: Simulated IoT integration reports spot status.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Automatic updates when a spot is occupied or freed.

### 📊 **4. Reporting & Analytics**
- **Admin Reports**: Real-time occupancy rates, revenue, and rule violations.
- **Top Users & Locations**: Displays most booked spots and highest revenue-generating lots.

### 🔔 **5. Notifications & Alerts**
- **User Notifications**: Alerts for reservation confirmation, expiry, and penalties.
- **Admin Alerts**: Issues warnings for over-occupancy and unpaid reservations.

### 🔑 **6. Authentication & Authorization**
- **Roles & Permissions**:
  - **Drivers**: Search, reserve, and pay for spots.
  - **Parking Lot Managers**: Manage lots, update statuses, view reports.
  - **System Administrators**: Manage system-wide operations.

### 🔄 **7. Transactions & Concurrency Control**
- **Consistency Management**: Ensures no double booking of spots.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Prevents multiple users from reserving the same spot.

### ⚡ **8. Scalability & Performance Considerations**
- **Indexing & Query Optimization**: Improves speed for large datasets.
